First problem:
the dd command took a very long time to complete and copy the image to the sd card
I was able to copy the image on a machine of one of my collegues.

Finding out IP addresses
We connected our Pis one-by-one and did a scan after connected. Then we knew which IP matches which Raspberry.

Connecting via SSH
The user to connect is "root" not "pi". Password was "raspberry".
For setting up SSH I followed this guide 
(https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md)

Then I did the setup of the static IP with opening /etc/network/interfaces
and wrote this code into it:

auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.3.109
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.3.1

After that I followed this tutorial to install the wiringPi library.
http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/
I had some problems because sudo wasn't installed, after doing so it worked out fine.
Also make did not work (Solution: apt-get install build-essentials)

Having the library installed I tried the example script "blink.c" (build it with make blink and then run it with ./blink)

Now I'm out of disk space and I need to run raspi-config to get more space but I can't install it because I have no disk space. 
Solved: used linux tool for partitioning
