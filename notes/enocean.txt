But the file on the boot partition was edited via the card reader from windows / mac directly

#add enocean jar to "addons"

#setup enocean
in the start.sh file
-Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyAMA0  

in openhab_default.cfg
# EnOcean USB adapter serial port   
enocean:serialPort=/dev/ttyAMA0  

"./start.sh"
