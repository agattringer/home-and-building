#Blinking LED via OpenHAB
I basically followed this tutorial https://mcuoneclipse.com/2015/12/24/blinky-led-with-openhab-on-raspberry-pi/

#Setting up 2 LEDs

However if a group switch is built, the switch works but there is currently no way to control the other switches with the "AllLEDs" switch.

#timer
Problem: UI doesn't refresh automatically
create *.rule file at the rules folder
import timer library
when LED1 changed to ON change it off after five seconds
