#mounting raspi file system
sshfs root@192.168.3.20:/etc /Users/alexandergattringer/Desktop/raspberry 

#Setting up Openhab
I used sshfs to mount the raspberry pie filesystem for easy drag and drop with the files
Openhab becomes available under the adress 192.168.3.20

#Blinking LED via OpenHAB
I basically followed this tutorial https://mcuoneclipse.com/2015/12/24/blinky-led-with-openhab-on-raspberry-pi/

#Setting up 2 LEDs
The simple version with separately switching the LEDs works like a charm.
However if a group switch is built, the switch works but there is currently no way to control the other switches with the "AllLEDs" switch.

#timer
Problem: UI doesn't refresh automatically
create *.rule file at the rules folder
import timer library
when LED1 changed to ON change it off after five seconds

#Using hardware button with Openhab
Wire up button with this scheme https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Tutorial/button.png
As Konrad pointed out you need to exchange the two JARs with new ones (

Problems:
-Correct wiring of Button (Pulldown, which direction to put it)

Find scripts in "OpenHAB" folder
