# Panel discussion
Comfort
Control home with smartphone + access panel 
Coffee machine maybe not the killer feature
Setting up scenes -> not only controlling lights with a software switch

Costs
Con: it can be really expensive (2,300$ for doing it yourself) and doesn't really save that much
You have to update often
Pro:  You can run your home 10 years without update

Software:
Con: Updates can be expensive, everything doesn't work perfectly together
Pro: Just choose one vendor, 

Interfaces:
Pro: Protocols like zigbee and zwave are wireless and comfortable to install

Security 
Con: 3 open source systems were compromised, Open source does not equal security
Pro: everything can be compromised

Privacy
Pro: You do not have to have cameras everywhere, depends on what you wanna do.
Con: Do you really want to be supervised everywhere? Who knows who has access to cameras, etc
