We built up the circuit as proposed, pluggied in the lock into the power circuit and manually enabled and disable the GPIO port. We were able to open the lock.

But trying to integrate an LED into the circuit was not possible as we expected.
Not enough voltage I guess.
We solved the problem with using a resistor for the LED and no resistor for the relais.
